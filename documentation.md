## Project Overview

The Smart Irrigation System is an intelligent web application designed to optimize water usage in agricultural settings. It combines real-time weather data, soil moisture readings, crop-specific requirements, and geographical information to provide precise irrigation recommendations. The system helps farmers make data-driven decisions about when and how much to irrigate their fields, leading to water conservation, reduced costs, and improved crop yields.

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Irrigation Recommendations**: Provides precise water amount calculations based on multiple factors
- **Crop-Specific Analysis**: Tailors recommendations to different crop types and their water requirements
- **Soil Type Consideration**: Accounts for different soil absorption and retention properties
- **Weather Integration**: Incorporates real-time and forecast weather data into calculations
- **Geographical Mapping**: Uses location data to customize recommendations for specific regions
- **Historical Data Tracking**: Maintains a comprehensive history of irrigation decisions
- **Data Visualization**: Presents irrigation history through interactive charts and tables
- **Responsive Design**: Functions seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design requiring minimal training to operate

## System Architecture

The Smart Irrigation System follows a modern web application architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend components.

      "city": "Chennai",
      "state": "Tamil Nadu",
      "country": "India"
    }
  }
]
```

## Frontend Components

### Map Component
The map component allows users to select a location either by clicking directly on the map or by searching for a place name. It uses Leaflet.js for rendering the map and OpenStreetMap for the map tiles.

```javascript
// Map initialization
const map = L.map('map').setView([20.5937, 78.9629], 5);
L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);
```

### Search Component
The search component allows users to find locations by name. It sends requests to the backend API, which uses the OpenStreetMap Nominatim service for geocoding.

```javascript
// Search functionality
async function searchLocations() {
  const query = searchInput.value.trim();
  if (!query) return;
  
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${API_BASE_URL}/locations/search/?q=${encodeURIComponent(query)}`);
    // Process and display results
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error searching for locations:', error);
  }
}
```

### Form Component
The form component collects user input for crop type, soil type, and location coordinates. It validates the input and submits it to the backend for processing.

### Results Display
The results component shows the irrigation recommendation, including water amount, duration, and status. It also displays additional information such as weather conditions and soil moisture.

### History Visualization
The history visualization component shows past irrigation decisions in both chart and table formats. It allows users to track patterns and trends over time.
